### Hey, welcome! 👋

#### A Frontend Developer by day ☼ and a "Dev to Community Articles" Contributor by night ☾

I write articles at [DevTo](https://dev.to/womanwithcode);

- ⚙️ I use daily: `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, `.reactnative`, `.react`
- 🌍 I'm mostly active within the **Meteor Lounge** and **Study with Soo**
- 💬 `ping` me about **Programming**, **Frontend Development**, **Javascript**
